# Move Lazy lockfile out of version control.  Lazy frequently updates this and I
# haven't figured out what triggers it.  I'm fed up running `git restore` to
# undo this, so let's move it outside of version control.  I've only once needed
# to roll back a plugin, and that was because of bad configuration on my part.
# This means that plugins won't get updated by update-dotfiles-and-bin, but
# that's OK, I'll just need to run update-dotfiles-and-bin-plugins
# everywhere.
